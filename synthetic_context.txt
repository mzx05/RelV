--- SYNTHETIC CONTEXT FOR QUESTION 5 ---
The Combined Company, formed by the merger of Valmet and Neles, faces potential risks that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, and future prospects. These risks include, but are not limited to, failure to protect or enforce intellectual property rights. Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. The importance of protecting and enforcing these rights cannot be overstated, as they serve to safeguard a company's competitive edge and financial interests. Valmet and Neles have taken measures to protect their intellectual property through patents, utility models, and trademarks. However, in certain emerging markets, products have been copied, leading to an increased emphasis on the protection and enforcement of these rights by the Combined Company.

--- SYNTHETIC CONTEXT FOR QUESTION 6 ---
The Merger between Valmet and Neles has been completed, but the future financing arrangements for the Combined Company are uncertain. While the New Facilities Agreements have been secured, exceptional financial market conditions could lead to increased costs and decreased availability of external financing. The Combined Company’s business success will play a significant role in determining the terms of future financing. However, efficient management of capital is equally important. Failures in managing capital, such as breaches of financial covenants or negligence related to financing arrangements, could result in premature termination of financing agreements or acceleration of credits and other financing arrangements. Some common financial covenants include debt-to-equity ratios, interest coverage ratios, and cash flow requirements.

The Pro Forma Information in the Merger Prospectus serves as a tool to help investors visualize the potential financial position and performance of the combined entity, Valmet and Neles, if their merger is completed. However, it's crucial to understand that these numbers are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a guarantee of the Combined Company's future financial situation or results. In fact, the Pro Forma Information may differ materially from the actual financial position and results of the Combined Company once the merger is complete. This is due to various risks and uncertainties that are inherent in any merger or acquisition process.


--- SYNTHETIC CONTEXT FOR QUESTION 8 ---

--- SYNTHETIC CONTEXT FOR QUESTION 9 ---
The Merger Plan stipulates that Neles shareholders, holding no more than 20% of all shares and votes, can demand redemption of their shares should they vote against the Merger at the EGM.

Valmet and Neles have estimated the total costs of the Merger to be approximately EUR 29 million, excluding financing transaction costs.

This was an essential step to streamline the integration process and provide investors with transparent and comparable financial information.


--- SYNTHETIC CONTEXT FOR QUESTION 12 ---
The pro forma financial statements reflect adjustments related to financing costs and tax impact due to the merger between Valmet and Neles. The financing adjustments decrease financial expenses by EUR 1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and increase financial expenses by EUR 2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The tax impact from these adjustments is calculated using the Finnish corporate income tax rate of 20 percent.

Additionally, the committee prepares for the election of independent auditors, monitors the statutory auditing of the financial statements and consolidated financial statements, assesses and reviews the auditors’ reports with the auditors, and ensures the independence of the auditors.

These targets reflect Neles' history of innovation and its leadership position in several process industries, including oil and gas refining, petrochemicals, and industrial gases. Since the 1990s, Neles has been a frontrunner in valve automation and digital solutions for flow control applications. However, the current pandemic has created uncertainty and risks of abrupt changes in all markets important to Neles, making it challenging to achieve these targets in the short-term.

The committee is composed of at least three members, one of whom is the Chair, and all members must be independent of the company and significant shareholders. The Audit Committee's duties include reviewing the company's financial statements, risk management practices, and internal audit reports. By performing these functions, the Audit Committee helps maintain investor confidence and ensure the long-term sustainability of Neles as a leading valve manufacturing company.
